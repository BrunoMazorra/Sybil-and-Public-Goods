# On the optimality of Shapley value mechanism for funding public excludable goods under false-name strategies

## Abstract

In the realm of cost-sharing mechanisms, the vulnerability to Sybil strategies —also known as false-name strategies, where agents create fake identities to manipulate outcomes— has not yet been studied. In this paper, we delve into the details of different cost-sharing mechanisms proposed in the literature, highlighting their non-Sybil-resistant nature. Furthermore, we prove that a Sybil-proof cost-sharing mechanism for public excludable goods under mild conditions is at least $(n+1)/2-$ approximate. This finding reveals an exponential increase in the worst-case social cost in environments where agents are restricted from using Sybil strategies. To circumvent these negative results, we introduce the concept of Sybil Welfare Invariant mechanisms, where a mechanism does not decrease its welfare under Sybil strategies when agents choose weak dominant strategies and have subjective prior beliefs over other players' actions. Finally, we prove that the Shapley value mechanism for symmetric and submodular cost functions holds this property, and so deduce that the worst-case social cost of this mechanism is the $n$th harmonic number $\mathcal H_n$ under equilibrium of the mechanism with Sybil strategies, matching the worst-case social cost bound for cost-sharing mechanisms. This finding suggests that any group of agents, each with private valuations, can fund public excludable goods both permissionless and anonymously, achieving efficiency comparable to that of permissioned and non-anonymous domains, even when the total number of participants is unknown.

## Main results

- We introduce a framework for analyzing cost-sharing mechanisms for public excludable goods with an unknown number of agents and Sybil strategies.
- We prove that the cost-sharing mechanism for public excludable goods with constant cost functions such as the Shapley value mechanism, the VCG mechanism for public excludable goods, and the potential mechanism are not truthful under Sybil strategies (i.e. are not Sybil-proof). 
- Moreover, in theorem 3.6 we prove that cost-sharing mechanisms with constant cost functions that are strong-monotonic, anonymous, individually rational, and Sybil-proof have worst-case welfare social cost bounded by $(n/2+1)$.
- Finally, we introduce Sybil welfare invariant mechanisms, and we prove that the Shapley value mechanism for non-decreasing symmetric and submodular cost-functions holds this property.
